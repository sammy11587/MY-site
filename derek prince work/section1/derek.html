      <h1>Derek Prince</h1>
      <p><strong>Peter Derek Vaughan Prince</strong> (14 August 1915 – 24 September 2003) 
        was a Bible teacher whose daily radio programme, <em>Derek Prince Legacy Radio</em>, is broadcast around the world in 
        various languages.</p>

      <h2 id="early-years">Early years</h2>
      <p>Derek Prince was born in India to British parents and was a scholar of Greek and Latin, 
        attending both <a href="#">Eton College</a> and <a href="#">Cambridge University</a>.</p>
      <p>At university, he described himself as an atheist, but while serving with the British army in World War II,
         he began studying the Bible and became a Christian.</p>

      <h2 id="ministry">Marriage and the growth of his ministry</h2>
      <p>Prince married Danish missionary Lydia Christensen in 1946, becoming father to her eight adopted daughters before the couple adopted another daughter
          The family moved to the USA in 1963 and pastored a church in Seattle. Prince worked at the Faith Tabernacle in Chicago, and then moved to Good
           News Church in <a href="#">ft.Lauderdale</a>, Florida.
           In May 1971 Derek Prince Publications opened offices in <a href="#">Ft. Lauderdale</a>, Florida. Derek Prince Publications became Derek Prince Ministries in December 1990.
           Lydia died in 1975, and Prince married Ruth Baker (who had three adopted children) in 1978. They moved to Jerusalem in 1981.
           The Princes traveled extensively in ministry until Ruth died on 29 December 1998. The following list of countries covers their
            ministry from 1993 to 1998. Some of these countries were visited more than once: Russia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Hungary, South Africa, Kenya,
             Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, Poland, Bahrain, Cuba, Colombia, Switzerland, France, Portugal, India and England.</p>

      <p>He is the author of 51 books, 600 audio and 100 videos, many of which has been translated and published in more than 60 languages.
        Some of the subjects that are covered in his teachings are prayer and fasting,[5] foundations of the Christian faith,
        <a href="#">spiritual warfare</a> ,God's love[8] and marriage and family.[9] His daily radio is translated into Arabic, Chinese
        (Amoy, Cantonese, Mandarin, Shanghainese, Swatow), Croatian, German, Malagasy, Mongolian, Russian, Tamil, Samoan, 
        Spanish, Bahasa Indonesia, Tongan, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Hindi and many other languages. The radio program continues
        to reach many people around the world.[citation needed]</p>

      <h2 id="deliverance">Demons and deliverance</h2>
      <p>As a <a href="#">Pentecostal</a>, Prince believed in the reality of spiritual forces operating in the world, and of the power of demons to cause 
        illness and psychological problems. While in Seattle, he was asked to perform an exorcism on a woman, and he came to believe that
         Christians could be "demonized"[11] (normally described as "possessed" by demons – Prince avoided this term which implies ownership).
          This was at odds with the more usual Pentecostal view that demons could possess unbelievers, but could only oppress Christians.
           Prince believed that his deliverance ministry used the power of God to defeat demons.</p>

      <h2 id="israel">Israel</h2>
      <p>Prince strongly opposed <a href="#">replacement theology</a>. His book The Destiny of Israel and the Church argues that the 
        Church has not replaced Israel and that the covenant that God made with the nation of Israel still stands today.
         Prince also believed that the creation of the <a href="#">state of Israel</a> was the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Derek states 
         in his book Promised Land, "The central theme of biblical prophecy, as it is being unfolded in our time, revolves around 
         the land and the people of Israel. God is carrying out His predetermined plan to regather the Jewish people from their worldwide 
         dispersion and restore them to their ancient homeland.

      <h3 id="Shepherding movement">Shepherding movement</h3>   
      <p>prince created the <a href="#">Shepherding movement</a> with fellow ministers <a href="#">Don Basham</a>, Bob Mumford, Charles Simpson and <a href="#">Ern Baxter</a>,
         who became known as the 'Fort Lauderdale Five.' They sought to counter what were seen as excesses within the <a href="#">Charismatic Movement</a>
         , by emphasizing discipleship and pastoral care. The practice of 'personal submission to spiritual authorities'
          was considered controversial.[16] Prince's association with the Shepherding movement provided international exposure. After
           leaving the movement, he focused on his own international ministry.</p> 
           
        <h4 id="Publications">Publications</h4>
